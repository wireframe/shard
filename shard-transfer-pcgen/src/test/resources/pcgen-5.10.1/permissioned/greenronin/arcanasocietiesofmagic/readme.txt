Green Ronin Publishing (http://www.greenronin.com) Arcana: Societies of Magic.

Notes:

1. The unarmed damage progression for the Green Steel Monk isn't working.

2. The Divine Avatar template is really more of a shell than anything else. It doesn't add stats automatically, since all of that is very much up to the DM.

3. The Moon Wraith Adept will NOT gain the Moon Wraith template automatically at 10th level. I tried adding the code but it added the template at first level. Odd.

If anyone can help me fix these issues, please let me know.
